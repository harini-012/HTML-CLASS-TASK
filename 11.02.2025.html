Early life
<span style="background-color:PaleGreen";>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[10] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[11] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father bowl to him.[12]</span>

In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli arranged for his son to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[13] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[14] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[15] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[16] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[14]

Kohli was a member of the Indian team that won the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and also captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019. He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and Delhi in domestic cricket.
